# dotfiles
Dotfiles for my personal linux computers
Meant for running on Arch Linux, with the i3 window manager

Some Highlights:
 * On pressing 'Mod4 + i', a floating vim window opens, preconfigured for writing LaTeX. On saving and closing, the content is automatically put into the clipboard. The shortcut is configured in '.config/i3/config', the script can be found in .config/insert_latex.
 * When pressing 'Mod4 + Shit + s', one can take a screenshot using xclip, which is automatically transferred to the clipboard. This is also configured in '.config/i3/config'
 * The background image, taken from [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Misty_forest_creek_(Unsplash).jpg):
